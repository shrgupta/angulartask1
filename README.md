Create a basic user login/registration system, i think this you have already implemented.
Use the same system if already done or else create a new system.

Create a basic catalog system features will be

1. Showing a list of products
2. Option to sort product by Price (high/low), Rating (high/low)
3. Paging 
4. Filtering System (filter by brand, price)

The features of the page will be like http://www.flipkart.com/mobiles/pr?p%5B%5D=facets.operating_system%255B%255D%3DAndroid&sid=tyy%2C4io&otracker=ch_vn_mobile_brand_Android

To implement, first add around 100 products in your mysql database. You can do this manually via phpmyadmin. 

Next implement the features just like on the link above, filter via price, brand. Sorting etc.
